# Obesity Control App (backend)

## Description
This is the backend repository for the Obesity Control App project.

Obesity Control App is a personal project that consists of a web application for a supposed obesity clinic interested in providing obesity treatments to its patients.

The application allows:
- That patients enter weekly data on their physical state and can consult the treatment that is being assigned to these states.
- That doctors can assign treatments to the physical states of patients who have not yet been assigned treatment, as well as search for patients to consult their history of states.
- That the office staff can manage the users of the application.
- That the administrator can do the same tasks as doctors and office personnel, and also be able to manage the treatments offered by the entity.

The backend is an API RESTful developed with <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank"> <img src="public/favicon.ico"> </a> version **8**, to which any frontend can be connected through its endpoints.
The frontend is in this [repository](https://github.com/noxxic3/o-c-a-frontend).
